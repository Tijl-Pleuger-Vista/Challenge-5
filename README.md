Login with NFC -> login with google account (if possible)

The game -> old school pokemon turn based fighting

NOTES:
Customer gets card linked to an account
When a customer has ordered something they can give their card to gain loot boxes sent to their account
Loot boxes give a random pokemon after opening
Loot boxes look like pokeballs
Use crud to interact with mysql (create new pokemons. Give lootboxes to accounts)
